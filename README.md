The test app to show the problem with dynamic bottom tabs styles.
   
- react: "17.0.2",
- react-native: "0.68.2",
- react-native-navigation: "^7.28.0"


## Resolution

Actually the bottom tabs can be themed using the `Navigation.setDefaultOptions` as in https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation/docs/style-theme/
